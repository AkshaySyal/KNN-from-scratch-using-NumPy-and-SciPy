# KNN-from-scratch-using-NumPy-and-SciPy
This project involved preprocessing the MNIST dataset (combining, flattening, and binarizing images, then converting to sparse format) and implementing a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier from scratch using cosine similarity to classify images, reporting performance on training, validation, and test sets
